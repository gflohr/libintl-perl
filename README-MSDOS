Installation
============

The package should build and run under MS-DOS (tested on version
"Windows 2000") but you may experience trouble when running the
test suite.  You will probably use a program called "nmake.exe"
that offers a minimum subset of the "make" program available on
regular systems.  That nmake program will not call a POSIX shell
to execute a command, but some toy command line interpreter with
numerous limitations, one of them being a ridiculously low limit
on the size of a command line.  And, alas, the size of the command 
line that will run the test suite will well go beyond this limit. :-(

Workarounds: a) format you hard disk and ... b) do not run the test
suite c) find a better make replacement for your system.
