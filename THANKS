These people have helped in the development of libintl-perl:

- Joshua Miller <unrtst@cpan.com> has extended libintl-perl to provide
  the important context-sensitive functions (pgettext() and friends).

- Christian Lackas <delta@lackas.net> has given various hints on 
  performance optimizations

- Ingrid Gräfen <ingrid.graefen@imperia.net> has fixed a major performance
  penalty on systems without POSIX::LC_MESSAGES, and she has extensively
  tested the Perl backend for GNU xgettext under cygwin 

- Bruno Haible for libiconv which was the base for many conversions and
  for integrating my Perl backend into GNU gettext
