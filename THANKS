  Enterprise Content Management System Imperia to the Perl community
  as free software. 

- Christian Lackas <delta@lackas.net> has given various hints on 
  performance optimizations

- Ingrid Gräfen <ingrid.graefen@imperia.net> has fixed a major performance
  penalty on systems without POSIX::LC_MESSAGES, and she has extensively
  tested the Perl backend for GNU xgettext under cygwin 

- Norma Karl <bcrazy@gmx.de> has thoroughly revised the documentation for
  the Perl backend to GNU xgettext, and because she deserves a credit
  anyway

- Bruno Haible for libiconv which was the base for many conversions and
  for integrating my Perl backend into GNU gettext
