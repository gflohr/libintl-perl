The files in this directory are part of the Imperia Enterprise Content 
Managment System.  They are not installed with libintl-perl.  They are only 
needed to generate the parser and the lexer for PO files and are included
here for completeness only.

In brief, this directory contains wisent.pl and ilex.pl.  The script ilex.pl
is a (f)lex-like scanner generator for lexical analysis.  The script 
wisent.pl is a yacc/bison like parser generator.  Both programs are fully 
functional but the documentation is fragmentary and may contain all kinds of 
errors.
